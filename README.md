Nova is a web-based financial management application for small groups, clubs, or flatshares. It provides features to track income, expenses, donations, and individual members' contributions. The app consists of a frontend written in HTML/JS, a Node.js backend for handling file uploads, email notifications, and configuration, and an embedded PocketBase instance for authentication and data storage.

## Features

- **Admin/User Views:** Distinct interfaces tailored for administrators and standard users.
- **Request Management (with approvals):** Users can submit requests (payments, status changes, expenses) which admins can review and approve or reject.
- **Person Management:** Track and manage members' statuses (e.g., Vollverdiener, Geringverdiener, etc.).
- **Payments & Standing Orders:** Record recurring and one-time payments efficiently.
- **Donations:** Separate tracking for general donations.
- **Expenses:** Log expenses with optional receipt uploads.

## Running the Application

Nova is distributed as an all-in-one Docker image. It includes the frontend, the backend server, and a bundled PocketBase process.

### Quick Start (Docker)

To run Nova, pull the latest image and start a container. Nova now keeps general app data and the PocketBase database in separate paths by default:

- `/app/data` for configuration, uploads, and the custom logo
- `/app/db` for the PocketBase database files

That makes it easy to place `/app/db` on faster cache/SSD storage while keeping the rest on larger HDD-backed storage.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ricouhd/nova:latest

docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/your/storage:/app/data \
  -v /path/to/your/cache:/app/db \
  --name nova-app \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/ricouhd/nova:latest
```

*Replace `/path/to/your/storage` and `/path/to/your/cache` with directories on your host machine to ensure your data survives container restarts.*

> **Unraid / Permission Note:** Nova starts as root only long enough to prepare bind-mounted `/app/data`, `/app/db`, and `/app/html` directories for the bundled `node` user (UID 1000), then drops back to `node` before starting the app. If your storage backend blocks ownership changes, make sure every mapped host directory is writable by UID 1000, e.g. `chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/your/storage /path/to/your/cache /path/to/your/frontend`.

### Optional: Frontend Volume Mapping

The frontend files are bundled directly in `/app/html` inside the container. If you want to customize the frontend (e.g. replace `index.html` or static assets), you can optionally map this path as well:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/your/storage:/app/data \
  -v /path/to/your/cache:/app/db \
  -v /path/to/your/frontend:/app/html \
  --name nova-app \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/ricouhd/nova:latest
```

*When mapping `/app/html`, Nova automatically copies the bundled frontend files from the image into that directory on the first start if `index.html` is missing. After that, your mapped files stay in place and you can customize them on disk.*

> **Custom logo storage:** The admin SVG upload is persisted in `/app/data/church-logo.svg`, not in `/app/html/assets/church-logo.svg`. The app serves `/assets/church-logo.svg` dynamically so the uploaded logo keeps working even when `/app/html` is mapped.

> **Reverse proxy note:** Nova trusts local/private reverse proxies by default so the bundled rate limiting works cleanly behind Docker reverse proxies. If your proxy setup is different, you can override Express' proxy handling with the `TRUST_PROXY` environment variable.

## Setup Wizard

When you first access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or your mapped port), you will be greeted by the built-in Setup Wizard. You only need to provide:

1. **App Name:** The name of your instance (e.g., Nova).
2. **Optional SVG Logo:** You can upload a custom logo directly during the wizard.
3. **SMTP Details (Optional):** Credentials for a mail server to send automated status and request notifications.

PocketBase is provisioned automatically inside the container. Nova stores its runtime configuration in `/app/data/config.json`, the uploaded logo in `/app/data/church-logo.svg`, and the PocketBase database in `/app/db` by default. If needed, you can override the database path with `DB_DIR` (or the more explicit `POCKETBASE_DIR`).

## First User Setup (Super-Admin)

The **first user who logs in after setup** is automatically promoted to:

- `admin: true` (regular admin/supervisor rights)
- `superAdmin: true` (advanced admin/admin rights)

The super-admin can then:

- promote/demote other users to regular admins (supervisors),
- edit recorded payments afterwards,
- update `assets/church-logo.svg` (church icon),
- update the app name and SMTP configuration directly from the advanced settings UI,
- use the temporary Firebase migration add-on to read the old Realtime Database directly into PocketBase.

The migration add-on accepts either the full legacy `/app/data/config.json` from the Firebase-based setup or the two old config blocks separately:

- `firebaseConfig`
- `serviceAccount`

It migrates the legacy database roots (`settings`, `system`, `donations`, `expenses`, `people`, `requests`, `users`) into the current PocketBase-backed structure. Existing PocketBase user profiles are updated when the same UID already exists there; Firebase Auth passwords are not transferred.

<summary><b>PocketBase access model</b></summary>

## PocketBase access model

Nova now provisions PocketBase automatically and configures the collections, indexes, and default records on startup. The effective permission model mirrors the previous Firebase rules:

- **Admins** can read and write all people, requests, donations, expenses, settings, and user records.
- **Regular users** can authenticate with PocketBase, read/update their own profile, read shared settings, read the public invite code, view only their linked person/request records, and submit their own requests.
- **The first logged-in user** is promoted to `superAdmin` and can manage admin roles plus the advanced system settings.
